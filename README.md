# Python-mini-project

This system is made using Tkinter and sqlite3 libraries in Python. It is a very basic representation of the system performing operations like insertion, deletion, search and retrieval of products. 
It can be expanded further by connecting to an RFID tag and reader hardware system that would update the database automatically.
